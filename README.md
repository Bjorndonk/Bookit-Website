# BookIt

This project was a collaboration with 5 other students. Together, we developed and hosted Bookit, a social website that allows its users to pull from a database of books, leave reviews, collect their favorites, and browse posted user reviews. Most of the work I contributed to the project was in back end database management, as well as populating webpages procedurally from the database for the website's various search functions.
